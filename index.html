        <p>This project is a TMC-RP1210b wrapper written in C# for .NET applications for use in communicating with automotive and industrial networks using commonly available hardware that confirms to the RP1210a or RP1210b specifications.</p>

<h3>What is RP1210</h3>

<p>RP1210 is a standardized API that was created for applications designed to communicate with vehicle networks with the original focus being heavy duty networks associated with trucks, buses, and ag. With the addition of ISO15765 devices and applications supporting RP1210b may now access all 2008 and new passenger vehicles as well.</p>

<p>RP1210 does not include definition or servicing of layers 5-7 of the OSI model. Depending on the protocol some network layer tasks need to be serviced within the application.</p>
