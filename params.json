With the addition of ISO15765 devices and applications supporting RP1210b may now access all 2008 and new passenger vehicles as well.\r\n\r\nRP1210 does not include definition or servicing of layers 5-7 of the OSI model. Depending on the protocol some network layer tasks need to be serviced within the application.\r\n\r\n","tagline":".Net Library & Tools for RP1210 Devices - J1939 & J1587 Only.
